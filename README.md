# Wire-Cam
This is code for a wire camera system like those in sports stadiums.

The code is for a personal, just-for-fun project.  It is written in C++, html, css, js, and jquery.

The frontend is a desktop application written with the Electron framework, allowing it to be written in html, css, and js.
The main loop of the program is run on a computer in C++, which communicates over a serial connection to an Arduino that tells the winches what speed to set.  The Arduino also sends data about encoders back to the computer.  The C++ on the computer then communicates to the frontend via a socket.
